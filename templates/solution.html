            <h2 class="fade-in ">How We Address the Problem</h2>
            <p class="slide-up">We create a website that collects menstrual waste from households and recycles it in our waste management plant.</p>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Segregation and Collection</h3>
            <ul class="slide-up">
                <li><strong>Collect the Waste:</strong> Menstrual waste is collected from households using our dedicated collection system. The collected waste is then transported to our waste management plant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Mechanical Drying to Remove Moisture</h3>
            <ul class="slide-up">
                <li><strong>Drying Chambers:</strong> Industrial-scale drying equipment is used for the large-scale drying of pads. This equipment works by removing moisture using heat and airflow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Gasification Process</h3>
            <ul class="slide-up">
                <li><strong>Pyrolysis:</strong> The dried pads are heated in the absence of oxygen in a closed chamber called a gasifier. As the pads are heated, organic material disintegrates to form a gas mixture containing carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Oxidation:</strong> Oxygen is introduced into the gasifier in a process known as partial oxidation. This reacts with the carbon in the pads to produce more carbon monoxide and hydrogen.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas Cleaning:</strong> The resulting gases primarily consist of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Carbon monoxide (CO)</li>
                        <li>Hydrogen (H2)</li>
                        <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2)</li>
                        <li>Methane (CH4)</li>
                        <li>Nitrogen (N2)</li>
                        <li>Other trace gases</li>
                    </ul>
                    These gases are cleaned and compressed to remove impurities such as tar and particulate matter. This involves passing the gas through filters or scrubbers.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="fade-in">Gas Utilization</h3>
            <ul class="slide-up">
                <li><strong>Combustion:</strong> The cleaned producer gas can be burned in a combustion engine to generate electricity or heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Syngas Production:</strong> The gas can also be further processed to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Syngas can be used as a feedstock for the production of fuels, chemicals, and other products.</li>
