            <h2><u> Waste Statistics</u></h2>
            <p>
                Around 12.3 billion sanitary napkins, amounting to 113,000 tonnes of waste, reach India’s landfills annually, the majority of which are non-biodegradable in nature, typically made from polypropylene and superabsorbent polymer powder (sodium polyacrylate).

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Plastic Pollution:</strong> Sanitary napkins are composed largely of plastic materials most of which are for single use and can’t be broken down for several years. This contributes to plastic pollution in landfills and waterways.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Contamination:</strong> The wrong disposal of this sanitary waste is also a significant cause of soil acidity as different chemicals from the plastics and absorbents can leach through to the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Discarding sanitary waste in rivers and streams can cause water pollution affecting organisms present in such waters and the health of those who depend on them for potable water.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>x
                <h2>Health Impacts</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Disease Transmission:</strong> Diseases can also be transmitted as a result of the improper disposal of such sanitary waste which might provide breeding sites for disease-causing organisms and even insects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respiratory Problems:</strong> Through the use of washroom incinerators, toxic fumes are released into the air, putting the health of users at risk by causing problems such as respiratory infections and other related ailments.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Social and Economic Impacts</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Stigma and Taboo:</strong> The topic of menstrual waste management is often stigmatized, leading to inadequate infrastructure and awareness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economic Burden:</strong> The cost of managing sanitary waste can be a burden on municipalities and communities, especially in rural areas with limited resources.</li>
